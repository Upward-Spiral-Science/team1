### Overview
Mental illness causes huge financial social burdens for those affected by it. Gaining an understanding of brain function brings the research community one step closer to understadning this plague on humanity. Brain structure is a good indicator of how the brain behaves. Understanding the structure of the brain may help us model functionality of brain feautres as function of synapse density. We have been analyzing the structure of the brain through synaptic density maps with the goal of understanging the connection between brain structure and brain function.

### Scientific Questioning
Reword so we're not plagiarizing...
We will discuss our analysis of this data, starting with exploratory and descriptive analysis, up to preliminary work on hypothesis testing and regression. The questions posed and their outcomes are described sequentially, with code and methods used to answer them described at the end of this report.

#### Descriptive Analysis
The natural first step when working with any data is to ask exploratory and descriptive questions about it. We have been working with the _____ dataset. The dataset consists of (x,y,z) coordinates, the number of synapses at that point and the unmasked value for that region. We began by seeking some basic understanding of this data. To understand the structure of our data, we first asked questions regarding charachteristics of the data such as dataset size, number of total synapses, and number of invalid (i.e. unmasked value = 0) data points were present in our data, what a histogram of the synapse density looks like. Below are the results of these questions. Another descriptive question asked regarded the meaning of the unmasked variable. After consulting with those familiar with the dataset who have an understanding of how the data was collected, we were able to gain an understanding of the meaning of the variable. The unmaksed value was a way to differentiate between boundary regions and those regions missing data from good-quality regions of data when the data was acquired. The mask represents regions which are to be ignored and are not meaningful data. More specifically, the unmasked value represents the number of voxels in that row which have meaningful data. Naturally, we suspected a relationship between the unmasked value and number of synapses at a given coordinate, and as such, tested for the correlation between the two. The correlation  between the unmasked value and number of synapses at a coordinate is 0.89621769. The final descriptive question asked regarded clustering of the data. We suspected a natural clustering of synapses to be present.

#### Exploratory Analysis
Knowing what the unmasked value is, we could remove invalid data entries where unmasked values were zero. With the remaining data, we sought to gain a general understanding of how the synapses are structured in the sample. 
Thus we asked how the data could be clustered and which metrics should be used to cluster the synapses. 
We used k-means, varying k-values. In terms of which metrics to be using, since we're dealing with objects in 3D space, Euclidean distance is the obvious choice.
These results are tabulated below.

We also asked about the values of mean and covariance of the probability mass function (f: R^3â†’[0, 1] where f(x, y, z)=probability that a synapse exists at (x, y, z)). The results are listed below.

To gain a better understanding of the limits of our dataset, we asked about the bounds of our (x,y,z) coordinates and the maximum number of synapses that occur at any one coordinate.

#### Inferential Analysis
We now seek to understand class conditional differences within our datasets. The covariate we are 
seeking to separate graphs based upon is sex. Firstly we must pick a feature of our graphs to test 
this difference under. As we'd looked at this feature in our exploratory analysis, we chose to use 
edge density as our feature. Running a wilcoxon test on this population, in which 22 subjects were 
male and 20 subjects were female, we found the following mean probabilities of edge based on class.

We found that the difference between these populations was statistically significant with an alpha 
value of 0.05, produciing a p value of 0.022768743719. Since we found a statistically significant 
difference between classes, we can naturally proceed to trying to classify subjects based on their 
edge density.

#### Predictive Analysis
Now that a relationship between synapses and the unmasked value has been observed, we can attempt to solidify
the relationship between synapses and the unmasked value. Several types of regressions were trained and tested using LOO cross-validation, 
and their results are tabulated below.

| Regressor | Accuracy | Standard Deviation |
|------------|----------|--------------------|
|K-Nearest Neighbors| 0.25 | +/- 2.54 |
|Linear SVR| 0.57 | +/- 0.18 |
|Linear| 0.62 | +/- 0.40 |
|Random Forest| 0.79 | +/- 0.51 |
|Polynomial Regression| 0.85 | +/- 0.27 |=

The regression accuracy on our data based on the five tested regression algorithms is, at best, 
85%, and, at worst, 18%. From the poor results of the K-nearest neighbors and linear SVR regressions, 
We see that the relationship between the variables (x,y,z,synapses) and the unmasked value is most likely
not linear due to the poorer performance of the linear regression compared to the very well-performing
polynomial regression. We believe K-nearest neighbors failed to the 
high dimensionality of our data. Distances become less representative of the data with increasing 
dimensionaltiy. Next, we plan to investigate why the polynomial regression and random forest regression performed relatively well and review our 
assumptions for accuracy and completeness as well as adjust our regression algorithm parameters
to better represent the true data as well as the adjusted assumptions. To gain more understanding of why
the regression algorithms performed the way they did, we reevaluated our procedure thus far and tested our assumptions.

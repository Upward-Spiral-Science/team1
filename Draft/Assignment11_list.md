#### Group
* Look at what other groups are doing, try the same things
-------------------------
* (A) How the number (or hexbin) of unmasked or density changed along x-y, y-z, x-z?
* (A) Apply box plot to density?

#### Akash
* What is the loss function being applied?
* What does regression look like for different degrees of the polynomial
* What is the description for knn and assumptions
* Check cluster densities? (how?)
* Anything interesting when rotating/comparing visualizing the centroid by density scatter plots?

#### Bijan

#### Emily
* See how synapse density in a layer varies in the X, Y, Z directions
* Looking at the y-layer: can we see layers of the cortex?
* How are synapses distributed in these possible "cortex layers"
* What bin is the spike in? Are the points included in the bin uniformly distributed?
* How does smoothing our data, say by applying a gaussian filter, affect the spike?

#3D Distribution of Synapses
Emily Marshall, Jay Miller, Akash Ray, Bijan Varjavand


##Opportunity
EM volumes will become substantially larger in the future due to increases in imaging throughput[1]. 
The ever-increasing resolution of datasets  allows for more refined understanding networks involved[3][4]. 
Algorithms to find relationships between the 3D distributions of synapses may be able to generate novel conclusions.

##Significance
Utilizing novel algorithms may allow us to generate more complete models of how neuronal circuits process information.
**Clinical significance: Akash**

##Feasibility
Algorithms to generate signal pathways have already been implemented, which utilize well-established tools for tracking synapses[2]. 
Datasets for such algorithms already exist and will only become more refined. 
Within the scope of this project we expect to generate potentially unique statistics resulting from synapse density. 
Possible progress includes new visual representations of the networks. 
This may allow us to draw different patterns regarding density and distribution of neural networks. 

##Innovation
If successful, the novel conclusions and models established will apply to all relevant research. 
It may also more fully define the relationship between different classes of synaptic targets (inhibitory vs. excitatory). 
This will allow for a more thorough analysis of data of previous and future neurological studies, 
and results may be able to be utilized for a finer understanding and control to modulate brain-state.

## Group:
  * What is the spike? More Visualizations,
                     Regressions ,
                     Clustering
  * Bic keeps getting better as we go up right now--look at more clusters!
  * Look at histograms of the x,y bics from last time
  * Sample 100 or 1000 samples and rerun x,y bic curve after sampling (run bic many times, take max for each k)
    because fragile to outliers
  * Look at the two kmeans center of clusters graphs in the z-layer. Better visualizations, which way do they trend?
  * Covariances from last hw as heat maps

## Emily:
  * Plot vector estimates on top of the z-layer cluster center graph to see if estimate makes sense.
  * Visualization of the "spike" (scatter plot)
  * Redo z-layer bics without setting random state (take max at each k)
  * Work off of jay's gradient of density estimate (not using uniques), compare the two
  * Visualization of clustering after running the bic curve for higher ks (kmeans)
  * In the spike:
   * Min/Max x-value
   * Min/Max y-value
   * Min/Max z-value
   * Max number of synapses at one point
   * Point at which max number of synpases occurs

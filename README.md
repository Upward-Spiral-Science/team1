- *Assignment 1*: [``./Draft/summary.md``](./Draft/summary.md)
  > Significan and Feasibility analysis of our proposed project topic. 

- *Assignment 2*: [``./Draft/questions.md``](./Draft/questions.md)
  > Asking the 6 types of scientific questions about our project topic

  > Begin answerting the descriptive and exploratory questions. After answering them, we will revise the questions and discuss those that we couldn't fully answer as well as ask follow-up informative questions.

- *Assignment 4*: [``./code/inferential_simulation.ipynb``](./code/inferential_simulation.ipynb)
  >  Formally asked inferential question about our data, and answered it on simulated data from the null model, alternate model, and real data

- *Assignment 5*: [``./code/regression_simulation.ipynb``](./code/regression_simulation.ipynb)
  > Formally asked classification question about our data, and answered it on simulated data from the alternate model, and real data

- *Assignment 6*: [``./code/test_assumptions.ipynb``](./code/test_assumptions.ipynb)
   > In the previous two assignments, we made assumptions about our data. Now, we will check them and see whether or not they are true, and if not, update our understanding or assumptions about our data to those which are *more* right.

- *Assignment 7*: [``presentation.pdf``](presentation.pdf)
  > Presentation about findings and methods used throughout the project.
